## Codebook

This codebook descripes the variables of the dataset "tidyData.csv". The dataset contains a total of 180 observations of 68 variables.
Subject and Activity Variables

    Subject: values of 1-30; each identify an individual that participated in the original study
    Activity: the activity the observed individual performed; a total of 6 different activities have been observed for each individual

Feature Variables

The original variables come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals timeAcceleraion-XYZ and timeGyroscope-XYZ. The variable is either a "time domain signal", indicated by the prefix 'time', or a "frequency domain signals", indicated by the prefix 'frequency'.

The original time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (timeBodyAcceleration-XYZ and timeGyroscopeAcceleration-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (timeBodyAccelerationJerk-XYZ and timeBodyGyroscopeJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (timeBodyAccelerationMag, timeGravityAccelerationMag, timeBodyAccelerationJerkMag, timeBodyGyroscopeMag, timeBodyGyroscopeJerkMag).

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing frequencyBodyAcceleration-XYZ, frequencyBodyAccelerationJerk-XYZ, frequencyBodyGyroscope-XYZ, frequencyBodyAccelerationJerkMag, frequencyBodyGyroscopeMag, frequencyBodyGyroscopeJerkMag. (frequency domain signals).

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

Each of these variables contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject of the original data. Each variable contains either the mean or the standard deviation of the original variable.
